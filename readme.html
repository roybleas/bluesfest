<p>The music festival has over 80 musicians/bands on 5 stages over 5 days.
With so many performances, choosing which artists to see on which days
requires some planning. The phone app provided by Bluesfest allows you to
create a wish list by performance, but not by artist. This is a typical
feature amongst other similar festival applications. It is a lot easier to
associate the user with a performance. Yet most artists at the Bluesfest
play on more than one day and sometimes on 3 or 4 days.So rather than
create a list of individual performances, I first want to create a list of
artists. Then juggle the performance times so I can see as many of them as
possible.</p>

<p>While at the festival I want to be able to keep track of my personal
schedule on my phone. So I can be at the correct stage at the correct time.
It is also important to be able to easily look up the musicians currently
on stage. There will be numerous times when you are passing a stage and
hear something you like from an artist you do not recognise.</p>
